    "# Prefix Language Modeling/Conditional Language Modeling: \n",
    "Prefix Language Modeling is a technique used in natural language processing where the model generates text based on a given condition or context(the prefix). This approach allows for more controlled generation of text as the model is conditioned on specific information before generating the subsequent text. It's a form of controlled text generation where the prefix acts as a guide to instruct the model on the kind of text to generate. In a machine translation, the prefix would be the source text in one language and the model generates the translation in the target language. Similarly, for summarization tasks, the prefix would be the original long text and the model would generate its summary. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the generated text needs to be relevant to certain input data ensuring that the output is contextually aligned with the prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Autoregressive Language Modeling:\n",
    "Autoregressive Language Modeling is a probabilistic model used to generate sequences of text by predicting one token at a time, where each token's prediction is dependent on the tokens that have been generated previously. This approach models the probability distribution of a token sequence in a way that each token is predicted based on its predecessors in the sequence, making the generation process inherently sequential and dependent on the previously generated context. Models like GPT are prime examples of autoregressive language models used for a wide range of tasks like text generation, conversation and even code generation. The autoregressive nature allows these models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text over long passages but the generation is not explicitly conditioned on external context beyond the text itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distinctions:\n",
    "1. Prefix Language Modeling allows for more control over the text generation process by conditioning the model on a given context or prefix, making it suitable for tasks that require outputs tailored to specific inputs whereas Autoregressive Language Modeling, generates text in a more free-form manner, predicting each subsequent token based on the previously generated ones without explicit external conditioning beyond the generated sequence itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prefix Language Modeling is particularly useful in tasks that require the model to generate text based on specific conditions or contexts, such as translation, summarization, or controlled content creation whereas Autoregressive Language Modeling is widely used for open-ended text generation tasks where the primary goal is to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on the sequence generated so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While both approaches involve predicting the likelihood of subsequent tokens in a sequence, Prefix Language Modeling explicitly incorporates external conditions or contexts into the generation process whereas Autoregressive Language Modeling relies solely on the inherent sequence of tokens generated up to the current point for prediction."

       "For the time being, however, he urged caution, saying: \"We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else.\"\n",
       "The Kepler telescope hunts for planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front - known as a transit. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light.\n",
       "The promising signal was observed during three transits - fewer than the astronomers would like to have in order to confidently announce a discovery.\n",
       "The work by Dr Kipping, his Columbia colleague Alex Teachey and citizen scientist Allan R Schmitt, assigns a confidence level of four sigma to the signal from the distant planetary system. The confidence level describes how unlikely it is that an experimental result is simply down to chance. If you express it in terms of tossing a coin, it's equivalent to tossing 15 heads in row.\n",
       "But Dr Kipping said this is not the best way to gauge the potential detection.\n",
       "He told BBC News: \"We're excited about it... statistically, formally, it's a very high probability. But do we really trust the statistics? That's something unquantifiable. Until we get the measurements from Hubble, it may as well be 50-50 in my mind.\"\n",
       "The candidate moon is known as Kepler-1625b I and is observed around a star that lies some 4,000 light-years from Earth. On account of its large size, team members have dubbed it a \"Nept-moon\".\n",
       "A current theory of planetary formation suggests such an object is unlikely to have formed in place with its Jupiter-mass planet, but would instead be an object captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of this planetary system.\n",
       "The researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one.\n",
       "A handful of possible candidates have come to light in the past, but none as yet has been confirmed.\n",
       "\"I'd say it's the best [candidate] we've had,\" Dr Kipping told me.\n",
       "\"Almost every time we hit a candidate, and it passes our tests, we invent more tests until it finally dies - until it fails one of the tests... in this case we've applied everything we've ever done and it's passed all of those tests. On the other hand, we only have three events.\"\n",

       "But the other evening at the Barbican Concert Hall in the City of London, I had a chance to review my instinctive feelings, during an extraordinary performance by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra from Amsterdam.\n",
       "They were playing music I don't know and (to be frank) don't really want to know: the huge, long, Symphony Number Seven by Anton Bruckner. But the performance was amazing.\n",
       "We were sitting in expensive seats set to the side, because we bought too late to put us in the middle of the hall.\n",
       "So instead of the traditional back view of the conductor, Mariss Jansons, we could see one side of his face, all the time. And it was utterly compelling.\n",
       "Mr Jansons is 72, and born in Latvia. He has been Concertgebouw chief conductor for 10 years, and there is a deep regard for him among the musicians. Seeing him (and them) in action, I am not surprised.\n",
       "With restrained gestures and the subtlest of facial expressions, he drew from the orchestra the most glorious performance.\n",
       "This was not a leader in charge of a production; it was a man among equals, enabling the ensemble to flower, joining their efforts to his to evoke the spirit of the music.\n",
       "It was one of three Bruckner symphonies performed on successive nights in London. They had had no full scale run-through of this huge work beforehand, no dress rehearsal. Some of the performers were new to Bruckner altogether.\n",
       "The rehearsals concentrated on the difficult bits, in particular the transitions of mood or speed.\n",
       "Mr Jansons knew he could trust the musicianship of his superb players. What he had to do was to realise the possibilities of the ensemble.\n",
       "No wonder the impact of it was so tremendous. Watching him sideways, I realised that what was happening was that effectively we were in on  the creation of the music, so listening was almost as if it were being invented in front of our ears.\n",
       "There was a revealing moment in the pause after the first movement. The conductor gave the tiniest of acknowledgements of satisfaction - so far - to the different orchestra sections; not a wink, but little movement of hands and eyes to indicate that what was supposed to be created was happening.\n",
       "And it was so fresh, so of the moment, that we in the audience were part of the performance as well. Listening again later to the Radio 3 live transmission was not the same experience, even if my speakers had been up to the vast sonorities of Bruckner.\n",
       "This was musical leadership of a very high order indeed, huge music conducted with abundant humanity.\n",
       "And in Mr Jansons' enabling rather than autocratic style of leadership there were some real lessons for business people who look to conducting to show them how to run an organisation.\n",
       "Afterwards, talking to a member of the orchestra, I got a few insights into the democratic structure of the orchestra, which may explain the balance of power between conductor and players.\n",
       "The 120 players are members of the orchestra association, which has three seats on the orchestra's board.\n",
       "Becoming a tenured Concertgebouw member is difficult. Prized vacancies on the band may attract as many as 250 applications from all over the world.\n",
       "These are whittled down, and then a nerve-wracking selection process takes place.\n",
       "Applicants audition behind a curtain, listened to be a committee of the players with whom a successful musician will eventually play: about 16 members of the orchestra, including all the players of the section for which the applicant will eventually join. Peer group judgment.\n",
       "This elimination round happens twice... and then there's a play-off with the curtain raised, so the selectors at last see who is playing for them.\n",
       "But even after the choice is decided, there is still uncertainty: successful entrants to the orchestra face a probationary year, and their services may be dispensed with during that time. Not just a possibility: this happens.\n",
       "No wonder the orchestra's standard is so high. No wonder a public performance can be realised on the spot in that miraculous way I heard (and saw) in London the other month.\n",
       "A huge mutual trust between players and conductor, all working on top form to create an experience for themselves and the listener, realised by the musicianship of a very great conductor indeed, and the band's respect for him.\n",
       "How much the bosses and managers of other organisations and companies could learn from that community of purpose.\n",
       "On the Royal Concertgebouw website there's confirmation of what orchestra members have told me about the experience of working with Mariss Jansons.\n",
       "The site itself asks: What is Mariss Jansons' secret? How does he consistently manage to take his orchestras to a higher level and garner international recognition?\n",
       "In answer it quotes from an interview in the Gramophone the conductor gave six years ago.\n",
       "\"It's my job,\" he told the magazine, \"to find out the orchestra's special qualities and preserve them. Then, if through a natural process, my own individuality adds something - and theirs to me - then it will be fine.\"\n",
       "A superbly modest summing up of what leadership can be. A natural process.\n",
       "It has to be said that this sort of relationship is not a given, even at the Royal Concertgebouw.\n",
       "One famous previous chief conductor (for 25 years), Bernard Haitink, is embroiled in a continuing row with the orchestra over what he says is his lack of involvement in its 125th anniversary celebrations last year.\n",
       "Mr Haitink has vowed he will never again conduct the band. The feeling may well be mutual, though I haven't asked.\n",
       "Sadly, however, the wonderful relationship between the orchestra and Mariss Jansons will soon be coming to an end. His health has been problematic for some years, and he has just announced that he will be giving up his chief conductorship next year.\n",
       "So there is not much time left to hear a consummate musician utterly in tune with consummate players. And to witness a remarkable example of leadership in action, with the result of it blooming before your very ears.\n",

       "So far, he said, it was not clear how sites were being compromised to host the scripts. Websites and servers run by individuals, small businesses, construction firms and telecom suppliers had all become unwitting hosts of the phishing tools, he added.\n",

       "This follows the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recently saying it was in favour of folic add being added to flour for bread in the UK.\n",
       "Folic acid is found naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, nuts and granary bread.\n",
       "It is added to some breakfast cereals, but it is very difficult for pregnant women to get enough from diet alone.\n",
       "That is why in 1992, the Department of Health in England recommended that women take folic acid supplements before pregnancy to reduce their risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect (NTD) - which involve defects of the brain, spine or spinal cord.\n",
       "But recent research shows that only 28% of pregnant women take them at the correct time.\n",
       "However the government has so far been reluctant to force manufacturers to add folic acid to all bread.\n",
       "This study, published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, said the current policy was not working and the UK should be following the example of the US in fortifying flour with folic acid.\n",
       "The US has seen a 23% fall in pregnancies with neural tube defects since the policy was introduced in 1998.\n",
       "The researchers estimated that a similar policy in the UK would have prevented 1,798 pregnancies with NTD in England and Wales, 152 in Scotland and 64 in Northern Ireland over a 14-year period up to 2012.\n",
       "This equates to a fall of 21% in pregnancies with neural tube defects over that period.\n",
       "While most of the NTD pregnancies are terminated, around 75 babies a year are born with serious disabilities.\n",
       "The research team, led by Prof Joan Morris from the Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said putting folic acid in flour was safe and could only be a good thing.\n",

       "\"(Last year) It was the same (kind of game). We won 1-0 at home and 2-0 away, so it was still a close game.\n",
       "\"We know that Lincoln are a team that can play football and would give everything. We knew it would be a tough game but I'm 100% sure we will go through.\"\n",
       "Lee Casciaro stunned the visitors with the only goal, the 34-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman having scored Gibraltar's first competitive goal against Scotland at Hampden last year.\n",
       "\"This is something people dream about,\" he told BBC Radio Five Live. \"This result is a remarkable thing for football.\"\n",
       "Asked if Celtic should be embarrassed by the defeat, he replied: \"No not really. They have only been training for the past two or three weeks, pre-season, we've been training close to two months already. We train every day.\n",
       "\"The weather benefited us and the pitch benefited us because they are not used to playing on an artificial pitch.\n",
       "\"We have got another 90 minutes to go and we will see if we can inflict more wounds on Celtic. We have just got to enjoy ourselves and we will see what happens.\n",
       "\"I have been lucky enough to score at Hampden Park so if I could score at Celtic it would be unimaginable.\"\",\"Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson expands on his TV analysis of how the Reds' improvement at the back is behind their rise up the Premier League table after they beat Southampton on Sunday to continue their push for a top-four place.\n",
       "The 3-4-2-1 formation that manager Brendan Rodgers has adopted since the end of last year suits their fast attacking players but has given them solidity at the back too.\n",
       "Liverpool have not become a defensive-minded team but that has given them a different way of winning games, compared to last season when their tactic was 'attack or bust' and they would concede goals but just look to outscore the opposition.\n",
       "They showed it against Southampton on Sunday in a game where they were not free-flowing going forward - they only had one shot at goal in the first 70 minutes - and came under a lot of pressure.\n",
       "They rode their luck a bit at St Mary's, especially with some of the decisions that went in their favour because Saints could have had at least one penalty.\n",
       "But their 2-0 win was their sixth clean sheet in a 10-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, and it is clear Rodgers can rely on his defence to win him points now too.\n",
       "Sometimes in football you stumble on to something that is successful.\n",
       "After paying £20m for centre-back Dejan Lovren in the summer, Liverpool clearly wanted and expected him to come in and be a ready-made rock.\n",
       "That did not happen.\n",
       "Rodgers was looking to play four at the back when he signed Lovren but it did not work - he would not have tried a three-man defence if it had.\n",
       "He probably did not plan to play Emre Can at the back either, although he had played in that position before.\n",
       "But he has been brilliant as part of that back three, and is able to play either side of Martin Skrtel - he has been on the right in the last few matches but operated on the left against Southampton.\n",
       "The thing about Can is that he can use the ball and his passing ability from that position has made a big difference to the team.\n",
       "Something else that has helped goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in particular is having a settled line-up at the back too.\n",
       "It was the same during my career - when you play alongside people regularly in defence you start to appreciate what each of them can do.\n",
       "Lovren came back in for Mamadou Sakho against Saints but that was their first change at the back for seven matches.\n",
       "They were a bit shaky at the back at first, but got better and better as the game went on.\n",
       "The real bonus has been the emergence of Jordon Ibe - not just in terms of what he offers going forward but defensively too.\n",
       "He really understands what the wing-back role is all about and he has got such fantastic pace that, even if he does make a mistake, he has got a chance of recovering.\n",
       "Slowly but surely, Rodgers is finding players he can rely on in every position and even better he has got competition for places too.\n",
       "At left wing-back he has alternated between a winger Lazar Markovic and a left-back Alberto Moreno, who is so attacking that it really suits his game.\n",
       "Rodgers has shoehorned his attack-minded and quick players into his team to try to recreate the pace he had going forward last season.\n",
       "It has taken him a while but he has managed it and found a system that allows them all to fit.\n",
       "Even without playing well on Sunday, Liverpool have beaten one of their major rivals for a top-four finish.\n",
       "It was a huge win anyway, but with Manchester United losing and Tottenham also dropping points it was a very good week for the Reds.\n",
       "Who will make it into the Champions League spots? Well I don't think Southampton can and I don't think Tottenham will.\n",
       "With Chelsea and Manchester City contesting the title, that leaves two places between three sides - Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool.\n",
       "Three months ago, when they lost to Crystal Palace and dropped to 12th in the table it did not look like Liverpool would be in the mix but all of a sudden they have taken off.\n",
       "Mark Lawrenson was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\",\"The incident occurred at the headquarters of the Siam Commercial Bank in Bangkok on Sunday night.\n",
       "Contract workers were upgrading the fire extinguisher system when a chemical retardant was released, apparently suffocating them.\n",
       "Police are investigating how the system was set off.\n",
       "The executives, Adisorn Pokha and Napong Suksanguan, are from a firm called Mega Planet, which had contracted out the work.\n",
       "They face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of negligence.\n",
       "Police Lt Gen Sanit Mahathaworn said they had expressed regret and were willing to pay compensation for damages, according to the Bangkok Post.\n",
       "The bank had said that an aerosol system called pyrogen was \"inadvertently activated and exhausted all the oxygen in the area\" as contractors were working on it.\n",
       "Pyrogen involves a mixture of gases including potassium carbonates, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and ammonia. The system works by removing all oxygen from the air to stifle a fire.\n",
       "Seven of those killed were contractors and one person was a bank security guard. Seven others were injured.\"]]\n",
